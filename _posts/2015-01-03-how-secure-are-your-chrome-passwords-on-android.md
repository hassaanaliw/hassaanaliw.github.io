----------

When you enter a password for a website into [Chrome on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en), chances are you see a prompt to save your password.

If you click yes, Chrome will save information about the page such as the names of the form elements as well as the <strong>password</strong> to a database called LoginData.
