                                <p>GradeGuide is an application built by The Michigan Daily that aims to better inform students
                                when they're choosing classes for an upcoming semester.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The backend is a combination of Flask and SQL. We designed the database management scripts as well 
                                    as the API for GradeGuide, focusing on structured data that is easy to extend and
                                    effecient response times so that the project scales well.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The frontend is largely built in ReactJS. We focused on keeping as much templating and calculations
                                    on the client side to reduce server load. ReactJS also allowed us to manage state more carefully
                                    and meant we were able to effectively separate layout and style in HTML and CSS from the state 
                                    management in React. 
                                </p>

                                <p>We focused on implementing a project structure that would be seen in a professional coding
                                   environment. The code is continuously linted with ESLint and Pylint. GradeGuide is also continuously
                                   integrated with CircleCI, running tests and linters on every push and preventing broken code 
                                   from being sent out into production.
                                </p>

                                <p> 
                                The next challenge with GradeGuide is expanding it to other schools. To do this, we'll have to write
                                our system to be easily extendable and modifiable so that spinning up an instance for a new school is painless.
                                </p>
